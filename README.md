# Last Tour Mod Forge 1.20.1
 
## What is *Last Tour*?

*Last Tour* is mainly an exploration-focused mod based on the manga *Girls' Last Tour*.  
The mod centers around the custom generation of a post-apocalyptic world and adds many elements inspired by the manga.

## Mod Integration

The mod will likely have many features coded directly, but for some harder-to-implement features, I will rely on other mods and integrate them into the custom terrain generation.

## About Me

This is my first Minecraft mod, and I have only a little experience with Java.  
This project is primarily a test, and I will also commonly use it to experiment with new features.
